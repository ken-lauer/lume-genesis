    "## Example 3: Time-dependent Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is adapted from https://github.com/svenreiche/Genesis-1.3-Version4/tree/master/examples/Example3-TimeDependent**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3, as a time-dependent simulation, differs from steady-state simulation by tracking multiple slices of the electron bunch through the undulator. This\n",
    "allows to resolve a band of frequencies, depending on the sample rate of the electron slices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning** this example requires a lot of memory and processor cores in order to be run in a reasonable amount of time. Your laptop may not be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, a set of slices is defined in the bunch-frame, which moves with the speed of the electrons. Therefore mostly the electrons stay at the same location while the radiation slips forward, namely by one wavelength per undulator period. In Genesis4 the coordinate \n",
    "in the bunch frame is given by `s`. This shouldn't be confused with `z` which is the position in the undulator where the bunch frame is evaluated. \n",
    "In the underlying model the variable `z` acts as the independent variable of a proposed Hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is based on the steady-state input deck of Example 1. To run time-dependent simulations, the lattice file does not need to be changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input File\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of the beam-frame is done with the `&time` namelist:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "&time\n",
    "slen = 20e-6\n",
    "sample = 3\n",
    "&end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the total length is 20 Âµm, with a sample rate of 3 times the reference wavelength (defined as `gammaref` in the main `setup` namelist).\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample rate cannot be smaller than 1 but can be increased as long as the sample rate is still smaller than the cooperation length. The choice of the sample rate also defines the spectral bandwidth according to Nyquist theorem. For the maximum sample rate the frequency is +/-50% around the central frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a larger sample rate, the bandwidth is restricted to `+/- 50/sample` percent.  Due to the underlying solver, the FEL must be well within the given bandwidth of the simulation. Genesis does not verify that this is the case, so it is up to you.  An example of such a scenario would be a simulation with a very large energy chirp in the electron beam or seed signal that is very different from the central frequency. On the other hand, the resonant frequency of the FEL does not need to be exactly the same as the central frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also one possible pitfall that the desired integration step size is not in conflict with the sample rate. This example configures an integration step size of 45 mm, which corresponds to three undulator periods. This means that after one single integration step, the field is pushed three wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sample rate is smaller (e.g., `sample = 1`), then after one integration step the field jumps over electron slices without interaction.\n",
    "As an example for `sample = 1` the field in slice is copied from slice `i` to slice `i+3`.  There is no interaction with slice `i+1` and `i+2`. As a consequence, the simulation acts as three independent simulations with a sample rate of `3`.  For this reason the example uses a sample rate of `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate a time-varying input parameter, we set up the simulation for a Gaussian current profile and a linear chirp.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that some profiles are defined with \n",
    "```asm\n",
    "&profile_gauss\n",
    "label=current\n",
    "c0 = 2500\n",
    "s0 = 10e-6\n",
    "sig = 6e-6\n",
    "&end\n",
    "\n",
    "&profile_polynom\n",
    "label=energy\n",
    "c0=11347.\n",
    "c1=1e7.\n",
    "&end\n",
    "```\n",
    "The upper is the current profile with an rms length of 6 microns. Since the beam frame is defined for 20 microns, starting at s=0 micron. The peak of the Gaussian is placed at s=10 microns with the `s0` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower namelist is the energy chirp of the electron bunch. That namelist supports higher polynomial order but the corresponding coefficent are defaulting to zero.\n",
    "Here only the constant and linear term is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assign these profiles to the beam parameters they are referred to by their name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```asm\n",
    "&beam\n",
    "current=@current\n",
    "gamma = @energy\n",
    "...\n",
    "&end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-simulation using much more resources than steady-state simulation and sufficient memory much be provided for storing the entire beam and field in memory.\n",
    "Also the output files can be very large. Therefore it is better to reduced them.\n",
    "One method is to only generate output after a given count of integration step. This is done in the track namelist with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```asm\n",
    "&track\n",
    "output_step=3\n",
    "&end\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case after each 3rd integration step there will be an output\n",
    "\n",
    "The other method is to exclude certain fields in the output in combination for a collective output of all slices, such as the mean energy in the electron beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is configured in the setup namelist:\n",
    "\n",
    "```asm\n",
    "&setup\n",
    "...\n",
    "field_global_stat = true\n",
    "beam_global_stat = true\n",
    "exclude_spatial_output = true\n",
    "exclude_fft_output = true\n",
    "&end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`exclude_spatial_output` supresses any spatial information (cente rposition and rms sizes) while `exclude_fft_output` affects the field divergence. The simulation runs a little bit faster with this configured since the 2D FFT of the field wave-fronts can be CPU intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global stats parameters can be found in the HDF5 group `/Global` in the corresponding field or beam group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step to run a SASE simulation to set the radiation power to zero and set the `shotnoise` parameter in the `setup` namelist to `1`."

    "The ``Field/Global`` group holds the evolution of the pulse energy and the on-axis far field intensity.\n",
    "Since Genesis allows for a lot of higher transverse modes to be emitted they are included in the calculation of the pulse energy for SASE simulation. This generates the bump in the semi-log plot. Often it is hard to see if there is an exponential gain.\n",

    "It is then convenient to plot the on-axis far-field intensity. Since it has no contribution from higher transverse modes it is a \"cleaner\" signal for the FEL process."
